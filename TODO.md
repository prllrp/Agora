# How it works
Agora Chat is a decentralized  ephemeral chat service
Messages are not saved and only transmitted in real time.
New rooms can be created and advertised to other users. 
Messages are signed with a Metamask wallet to prove identity through cryptographic proof. 
Each message can be  signed with an Alias, but Aliases are not unique.
The frontend is built with Nuxt and built for client side rendering. 
The backend is built with IPFS PubSub. Connections, rooms and messages are all handled through pubsub rooms. 
These rooms can be interacted with from independent IPFS nodes, but the messages will not display on the front end unless they follow the correct format.
